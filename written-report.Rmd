library(broom)
library(patchwork)
library(knitr)
```

```{r load-data}
fire <- readr::read_csv('data/all_conditions.csv')
```

###Introduction

We started by creating distribution plots for each of the continuous variables.



```{r}
ggplot(data = fire, aes(x = 'Avg Soil Temp (F)')) +
  geom_histogram(stat = "count") +
  labs(x = "Avg Soil Temp (F)",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Distribution of Avg Soil Temp (F)")
```
