**Forecasting Forest Fires**

Climate change is one of the most important issues facing the world as a real
threat to the sustainability of human society. One of the consequences of
climate change which we are already experiencing today is an increase in forest
fires. In this project, we investigated data on environmental conditions in
regions throughout California, a state with a particularly high number of forest
fires. We performed a logistic regression analysis to determine which 
environmental variables are the greatest predictors of forest fires. Based on 
our final model, the most impactful factors are ETo, solar radiation, soil 
temperature, wind run, dewpoint, air tempertaure, and windspeed.
